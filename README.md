# CURVETOPIA: A Journey into the World of Curves

## Project Overview

CURVETOPIA is a project focused on identifying, regularizing, and beautifying various types of curves in 2D Euclidean space. The main goal is to take line art in the form of polylines and output a set of curves defined as connected sequences of cubic BÃ©zier curves. The project involves curve regularization, symmetry detection, and the completion of incomplete curves. Results are visualized in SVG format.

## Features

- **Curve Regularization:** Smoothens and regularizes the input curves.
- **Symmetry Detection:** Detects and exploits symmetry in the curves for beautification.
- **Curve Completion:** Completes incomplete curves based on existing curve data.
- **Visualization:** Outputs the final curves in SVG format for easy viewing and further processing.
